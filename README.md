## üé® Design Motivation

- **Modern, Clean UI**: Uses a palette of blue and white, with gradients for headers and cards, and rounded corners for a friendly look.
- **Consistency**: Common CSS variables and components ensure a unified look across all pages.
- **Responsiveness**: Grid and flex layouts adapt to all screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast colors, focus states, and semantic HTML.
- **Attribution**: TMDB logo and link are always visible in the footer, as required by their API terms.

**Design inspiration**: The interface is inspired by modern dashboard and analytics tools, focusing on clarity, ease of navigation, and data visualization. The use of cards, grids, and clear section headers helps users quickly find and interpret information.
